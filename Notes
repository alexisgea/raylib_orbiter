# TODO notes

Camera

- smooth zoom in / out
- add option to use scale instead of zoom -> specific to this types of space projects
- smooth rotations
- change orbital target on click
- smooth move to new target
- externalise camera system to reuse in other project (even if just as a debug  cam)

Dev tools

- draw spheres
- draw orbits (lines)
- draw vectory (lines arrows if possible)

Particles

- draw quads looking at cam at all time -> anything particles
